# DevOps Center Workflow (End-to-End)

## Learning Objective

Master the complete DevOps Center workflow from feature request to production deployment using a real-world example.

## The Complete Workflow

Let's walk through a real scenario that you'll face at Australia Post:

**Feature Request:** The sales team needs a new custom field on the Opportunity object to track **"Competitor Name"**.

We'll take this from idea to production using DevOps Center.

## STEP 1: Create Work Item (2 Minutes)

### Why Work Items Matter

Work items are the foundation of Dev Ops Center. They:
- Track what needs to be done
- Associate changes with requirements
- Provide audit trail
- Enable rollback if needed

### Creating the Work Item

In DevOps Center:

1. Click **"Work Items"** tab
2. Click **"New Work Item"**
3. Fill in details:

```
Title: Add Competitor Name field to Opportunity

Type: Feature

Priority: Medium

Description:
Sales team needs to track competitor names for reporting.

Requirements:
- Custom field: Competitor_Name__c
- Type: Text(100)
- Help Text: 'Name of primary competitor for this opportunity'
- Required: No
- Add to Opportunity page layout
- Add to relevant reports

Acceptance Criteria:
- Field visible on Opportunity page
- Users can enter competitor names
- Field appears in standard reports
- No impact to existing functionality
```

4. **Assign to:** Your name (or team member)
5. **Team:** Sales Cloud Team
6. **Sprint:** Current sprint
7. Click **"Save"**

### Result

- Work Item number created: **W-0001234**
- Status: **"New"**
- Visible to team in DevOps Center

    DC-->>Dev: "Ready to develop!"

    Dev->>Sandbox: Create custom field<br/>Competitor_Name__c
    Dev->>Sandbox: Add to page layout
    Dev->>Sandbox: Test the field

    Dev->>DC: Click "Commit Changes"
    DC->>Sandbox: Retrieve metadata
    DC->>GH: Commit to feature branch
    GH-->>DC: Commit successful
    DC-->>Dev: "Changes committed ‚úÖ"
```

### Step-by-Step Development

#### 1. Open Work Item W-0001234

- In DevOps Center, find your work item
- Click **"Start Development"**
- Select environment: **"Dev Sandbox"**

#### 2. DevOps Center Automatically:

- Creates Git branch: `feature/W-0001234-competitor-field`
- Links branch to work item
- Opens your Dev Sandbox

#### 3. Make Changes in Dev Sandbox

**Create the custom field:**

```
Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Opportunity
Fields & Relationships ‚Üí New

Field Type: Text
Field Label: Competitor Name
Field Name: Competitor_Name__c
Length: 100
Help Text: Name of primary competitor for this opportunity
Required: No
Default Value: (blank)

Click Next ‚Üí Next ‚Üí Save
```

**Add to page layout:**

```
Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Opportunity
Page Layouts ‚Üí Opportunity Layout
Drag "Competitor Name" field to Opportunity Information section
Save
```

**Add field-level security:**

```
Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Opportunity
Fields & Relationships ‚Üí Competitor_Name__c
Set Field-Level Security
‚úÖ Visible for all profiles
Save
```

#### 4. Test Your Change

1. Navigate to any Opportunity
2. See the new "Competitor Name" field
3. Enter test data: "Competitor ABC"
4. Save
5. Verify field displays correctly
6. Test on mobile layout (if applicable)

#### 5. Commit Changes

Back in DevOps Center:

1. Click **"Commit Changes"** on work item
2. Add commit message:
   ```
   feat: Add Competitor Name field to Opportunity object

   - Created Competitor_Name__c text field (100 char)
   - Added to Opportunity page layout
   - Set field-level security for all profiles
   - Tested field functionality

   Work Item: W-0001234
   ```
3. Click **"Commit"**

#### 6. What Happens Behind the Scenes

DevOps Center automatically:
- Retrieves metadata from Dev Sandbox
- Detects what changed:
  - `objects/Opportunity/fields/Competitor_Name__c.field-meta.xml`
  - `layouts/Opportunity-Opportunity Layout.layout-meta.xml`
  - `profiles/*.profile-meta.xml`
- Commits to Git branch
- Updates work item status

**You don't write these commands - DevOps Center does it automatically!**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Work Items Track Everything** - Every change is traceable
2. **Automated Git Operations** - No manual Git commands needed
3. **Multiple Approval Gates** - QA, UAT, Production approvals
4. **Full Audit Trail** - Know who changed what, when, and why
5. **Easy Rollback** - Can revert to any previous version
6. **Team Collaboration** - Developers, QA, Business all involved
7. **Production-Grade Process** - Enterprise-quality deployment

## Quick Check

Before moving on, make sure you can answer:

1. **What happens when you click 'Start Development'?**
   - Answer: DevOps Center creates a Git feature branch and links it to the work item

2. **How do you promote a change from Test to UAT?**
   - Answer: Click "Promote", select UAT as target, choose test options, and click "Promote Now"

3. **What's a Change Bundle?**
   - Answer: A collection of metadata changes (fields, layouts, etc.) packaged together for deployment

4. **Why do we have multiple environments (Dev, Test, UAT, Prod)?**
   - Answer: Each environment provides a quality gate - catching issues before they reach production

## Next Steps

You've seen a simple change flow through the pipeline. Now let's explore complex scenarios like merge conflicts, hotfixes, and large releases.
