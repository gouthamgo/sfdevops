# Interview Prep & Git Workflows

**Section Goal**: Master the practical knowledge needed to ace Salesforce DevOps interviews and excel in your first 90 days on the job.

---

## You've Learned the Foundations. Now Get Interview-Ready.

You understand CI/CD concepts, version control, testing, and deployment pipelines.

**But can you answer**: "Walk me through your Git branching strategy for a team of 50 developers"?

**Can you explain**: "Show me your daily Git workflow from morning coffee to end-of-day commit"?

**Can you demonstrate**: "Here's a CI/CD pipeline I built from scratch. Let me show you how it works"?

**Technical knowledge gets you to the interview. Practical application gets you the job.**

This section bridges that gap.

## Let's Get Started

**Choose your starting point**:

**Option A - Systematic Learner**: Start with [Git Branching Strategies →](./git-branching-strategies) and go through each page in order

**Option B - Interview Tomorrow**: Jump to [Technical Interview Questions →](./technical-interview-questions) and practice the most common questions

**Option C - Need Portfolio**: Start with [Building Your Portfolio →](./portfolio-strategy) and begin the CI/CD pipeline project today

**Option D - Behavioral Focused**: Go to [Behavioral Interview Prep →](./behavioral-interview-prep) and prepare your STAR stories

---

## Remember This

**Knowledge without application is just trivia.**

You can memorize every Git command, every branching strategy, every pipeline stage.

But in the interview, when they ask "Show me what you've built," you need something to show.

**Start building today.**

Create one repository. Write one script. Deploy to one sandbox. Record one demo.

Then tomorrow, do it again.

In 4 weeks, you'll have a portfolio that proves you can do the job.

In 12 weeks, you could be starting your new role as DevOps Lead at Australia Post.

**Or** you could still be "planning to start soon."

The choice is yours.

Let's go.
