## Total Compensation Breakdown

### Components of Tech Compensation

**1. Base Salary**
```markdown
✅ Guaranteed cash you receive every paycheck
✅ Used to calculate 401k match, bonuses (often % of base)
✅ Most stable component
❌ Usually smallest component at senior levels

Negotiation tip: This is your floor. Negotiate this first.
```

**2. Signing Bonus**
```markdown
✅ One-time cash payment (usually in first paycheck)
✅ Often used to offset equity you're leaving behind
✅ Highly negotiable
⚠️ May have 1-year clawback if you leave

Typical ranges:
- Junior: $10K-$25K
- Mid: $25K-$75K
- Senior: $75K-$200K
- Staff+: $200K-$500K

Negotiation tip: Ask for signing bonus to cover:
- Unvested equity at current company
- Relocation costs
- Gap until first equity vesting
```

**3. Equity / Stock Options**
```markdown
Types:
- RSUs (Restricted Stock Units): Most common at public companies
- Stock Options: Common at startups
- Performance Stock Units (PSUs): Tied to performance metrics

Vesting schedules:
- Standard: 25% per year over 4 years
- Backloaded: 5%, 15%, 40%, 40% (Amazon style)
- Monthly: 1/48th per month over 4 years
- Cliff: Wait 1 year, then 25% vests, rest monthly

❗ Key question to ask:
"What's the strike price and current valuation?" (for options)
"How many shares, not dollar value?" (for RSUs)
"What's the vesting schedule?"
"Is there a cliff?"
```

**4. Annual Bonus**
```markdown
Types:
- Performance bonus: Based on your performance (10-20% of base)
- Company bonus: Based on company performance (5-15% of base)
- Guaranteed first year: Some companies guarantee Year 1 bonus

Example (E4 at Google):
- Target: 15% of base
- Base: $180K
- Target bonus: $27K
- Actual: Can be 0% to 200% of target ($0-$54K)

Negotiation tip: Ask about target and historical payout percentages
```

**5. Equity Refreshers**
```markdown
Annual equity grants to retain you (after initial grant starts vesting out)

Example:
- Year 1: Initial grant vesting (25%)
- Year 2: Initial (25%) + Refresher 1 (25%)
- Year 3: Initial (25%) + Refresher 1 (25%) + Refresher 2 (25%)
- Year 4: Initial (25%) + Refresher 1 (25%) + Refresher 2 (25%) + Refresher 3 (25%)

This creates the "golden handcuffs" - your comp goes UP over time.

Negotiation tip: Ask about typical refresher amounts during negotiation
```

**6. Benefits**
```markdown
Healthcare:
- Medical, dental, vision (usually free or subsidized)
- HSA contributions: $1K-$3K per year
- Life insurance, disability

Perks:
- 401k match: 3-6% (some companies like Meta: 50% match on first 6%)
- Commuter benefits: $300/month
- Wellness stipend: $100-$500/month
- Learning budget: $1K-$5K/year
- Equipment: $3K+ (laptop, monitors, chair, desk)

Total value: $10K-$30K per year

Negotiation tip: Less negotiable, but ask about relocation, remote work
```

## The Negotiation Process: Step-by-Step

### Phase 1: Before You Interview

**1. Research Your Market Value**

```bash
# Resources to use:
✅ levels.fyi - Real salary data from tech workers
✅ Glassdoor - Company reviews and salaries
✅ Blind - Anonymous tech worker discussions
✅ Payscale - Salary calculator
✅ Your network - Ask people in similar roles

# Create your target range:
Your minimum (walk away): $XXX,XXX
Your target (happy): $XXX,XXX
Your dream (reach): $XXX,XXX
```

**2. Document Your Achievements**

```markdown
For each major accomplishment, document:
- Problem: What was the challenge?
- Action: What did you do?
- Result: What was the measurable impact?
- Scale: How many users/systems affected?

Example:
"Reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes by implementing
automated CI/CD pipeline, enabling daily deployments and reducing
production incidents by 65% across 3 teams (30 developers)."

Keep a "brag document" updated monthly!
```

### Phase 2: During Interviews

**The Salary Question: "What are your compensation expectations?"**

**❌ Don't say:**
- "I'm currently making $120K"
- "I'd like $150K"
- "I'm flexible"
- "Whatever is fair"

**✅ Do say:**

**Option 1 - Deflect Early:**
```
"I'm focusing on finding the right role fit first. I'm confident
we can come to an agreement on compensation if we're mutually
excited about working together. Can you tell me more about the
role's responsibilities and growth opportunities?"
```

**Option 2 - Provide a Range (if pressed):**
```
"Based on my research for a [Senior DevOps Engineer] role in
[San Francisco] with [8 years experience] and expertise in
[Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD], I'm seeing total compensation
in the range of $250K to $320K. But I'm flexible depending on
the full package - equity, growth opportunities, and team fit."
```

**Option 3 - Turn it Around:**
```
"Before discussing specific numbers, I'd love to understand
what you've budgeted for this role? That will help me understand
if we're in the same ballpark."
```

**If They Insist on Current Salary:**

```
"My current compensation includes some unique circumstances
[equity vesting, bonus structure, remote flexibility] that make
direct comparison difficult. I'm more interested in what this
role offers. What's the compensation range for this position?"
```

**If You're in California, Colorado, or NYC:**
```
"I know [state/city] requires you to disclose the salary range
for this position. Could you share that with me?"
```

### Phase 3: After the Offer

**Day 1: Receive Offer**

```markdown
Recruiter: "Congratulations! We'd like to offer you the role at
$180K base, $200K equity over 4 years, $20K signing bonus."

You: "Thank you! I'm excited about this opportunity. Can you
send me the full written offer with all the details? I'll need
[3-5 business days] to review everything carefully."

❗ NEVER accept on the spot
❗ ALWAYS ask for written offer
❗ ALWAYS take time to review
```

**Day 2-3: Analyze the Offer**

Create a comparison spreadsheet:

| Component | Offer A (Google) | Offer B (Startup) | Your Target |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Base Salary** | $180K | $160K | $175K |
| **Signing Bonus** | $40K | $25K | $30K |
| **Equity (Year 1)** | $100K | $80K* | $90K |
| **Equity (4 years)** | $400K | $320K* | $360K |
| **Bonus (Target)** | $27K (15%) | $16K (10%) | $20K |
| **Year 1 Total** | $347K | $281K | $315K |
| **4-Year Total** | $1.12M | $961K | $1.05M |

*Note: Startup equity value is speculative

**Day 3-4: Prepare Your Counteroffer**

```markdown
Determine:
1. What do you want to negotiate?
   ☐ Base salary (+$XXK)
   ☐ Equity (+$XXK or +X,XXX shares)
   ☐ Signing bonus (+$XXK)
   ☐ Bonus target (15% → 20%)
   ☐ Start level (L4 → L5)
   ☐ Other (remote days, education budget)

2. What's your justification?
   ☐ Competing offer (strongest)
   ☐ Market data (levels.fyi, Blind)
   ☐ Your unique value (rare skillset)
   ☐ Leaving unvested equity
   ☐ Relocation costs

3. What's your walk-away point?
   Minimum acceptable: $XXX,XXX total comp
```

**Day 4-5: Negotiate**

**Email Template (for first counter):**

```
Subject: [Your Name] - Offer Discussion

Hi [Recruiter Name],

Thank you again for the offer! I'm genuinely excited about
[specific aspect of role/team/company] and can see myself
making a significant impact, particularly around [specific area].

I've carefully reviewed the offer and want to be transparent:
I'm currently considering another opportunity with a total
compensation of [competing offer TC or range].

Given my [X years of experience], my track record of [specific
achievement], and the market rate for this role, I was hoping
we could discuss adjusting the package to:

- Base salary: $XXX,XXX (up from $XXX,XXX)
- Equity: $XXX,XXX over 4 years (up from $XXX,XXX)
- Signing bonus: $XX,XXX (up from $XX,XXX)

[OR: Total compensation of $XXX,XXX]

This would make the decision straightforward for me, and I'd
be thrilled to accept and give my notice immediately.

Are you able to go back to the team with this? I'm happy to
jump on a call to discuss.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**Phone Script (for verbal negotiation):**

```
You: "Thanks for sending the offer. I'm really excited about
the role, especially [specific thing]. I do want to discuss
the compensation."

Recruiter: "Sure, what are you thinking?"

You: "Based on [my experience / market data / competing offer],
I was expecting total compensation in the range of $XXX-$XXX.
Is there any flexibility to get closer to that range?"

[PAUSE - Let them respond]

Recruiter: "Let me see what I can do. What specific components
are most important to you?"

You: "I'm most focused on [base salary / equity / total comp].
Would it be possible to [specific ask]?"

[PAUSE - Let them respond]
```

**Handling Common Responses:**

**"This is our final offer."**
```
"I appreciate that, but I want to make sure we're on the same
page. This role is a [X%] increase in responsibility from my
current position, and I'm leaving behind [unvested equity /
bonus]. Is there any flexibility on [specific component]?"

If truly final: "I understand. Can I take 24 hours to think
about it?"
```

**"We can't move on base, but we can add equity."**
```
"I appreciate the flexibility. To be honest, I value base
salary more highly [because: more stable / affects 401k /
affects bonus calculation]. Would you consider [splitting the
difference / smaller equity increase + some base increase]?"
```

**"What competing offer are you considering?"**
```
"I don't feel comfortable sharing specific details out of
respect for the other company, but the total compensation is
in the range of $XXX-$XXX. I'm more excited about your role
because [specific reasons], which is why I wanted to see if
we could get closer on compensation."
```

**"Can you send us the competing offer letter?"**
```
"I'm not comfortable sharing confidential offer documents.
However, I can confirm the total compensation is [range].
I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement here because
this is my top choice."
```

**Phase 4: Closing**

**When They Meet Your Number:**
```
"That's fantastic! I really appreciate you working with me
on this. Let me review the updated written offer, and I'll
get back to you by [tomorrow / end of week] with my decision."
```

**When They Don't Fully Meet Your Number:**
```
"I appreciate you going back to the team. I'm at $XXX now,
and you're at $XXX. Is there anything else we can do to
close the gap? [Signing bonus / equity refreshers / level /
remote flexibility]?"

If no: "Let me think about it overnight and get back to you."
```

**Accepting the Offer:**
```
Email:

Hi [Recruiter],

I'm excited to accept the offer! The total package of
[summarize: $XXK base, $XXK equity, $XXK signing bonus]
works for me.

Can you send me:
1. Final written offer letter
2. Equity agreement details
3. Benefits summary
4. Next steps for onboarding

My anticipated start date is [date], giving [current company]
[2-4 weeks] notice.

Looking forward to joining the team!

## Advanced Negotiation Tactics

### 1. The Competing Offer Strategy

**Most Powerful Tool**: Having multiple offers

```markdown
Scenario: You have 2-3 offers

Step 1: Get all offers in writing
Step 2: Create comparison spreadsheet
Step 3: Identify your top choice
Step 4: Use other offers to negotiate with top choice

Example:
"I have an offer from [Company X] at $320K total comp.
I prefer your role because [reasons], but the compensation
gap is significant. Is there any way to get closer?"

Results:
- 70% of the time: They improve the offer
- 20% of the time: They don't budge
- 10% of the time: They rescind (rare, and you have backup)
```

**What if you don't have competing offers?**

Option 1: Apply to more companies simultaneously
Option 2: Use market data instead
```
"Based on levels.fyi and conversations with my network,
L5 DevOps Engineers at similar companies are seeing $320-360K.
Given my experience with [rare skill], I was hoping to be in
that range."
```

### 2. The "I'm Leaving Money on the Table" Tactic

```markdown
Calculate your unvested equity:

Current Company Equity:
- Remaining RSUs: 500 shares
- Current stock price: $200
- Unvested value: $100,000

Ask for signing bonus to cover:
"I'm leaving $100K in unvested equity. Would you be able to
offer a signing bonus to offset that?"

This works because:
✅ It's objective (you ARE leaving money)
✅ It's a one-time ask (signing bonus doesn't affect future budgets)
✅ It's fair (you're not asking for more, just replacement)
```

### 3. The Level Bump Strategy

```markdown
Scenario: Offered L4, but you think you're L5

Research:
- What's the difference in scope?
- What's the TC difference? (usually $50-100K)
- Do you meet L5 criteria?

Approach:
"I'm excited about the offer. Based on my [X years experience]
and [specific achievements at scale], I was expecting to come
in at L5. Can we discuss what it would take to be leveled at
L5, or what the performance expectations would be for a 6-month
promotion to L5?"

Results:
- Best case: Bumped to L5 immediately (+$50-100K)
- Middle case: Written 6-month promotion plan
- Worst case: Clear gap analysis for future promotion
```

### 4. The Equity Refresher Guarantee

```markdown
Problem: Initial grant is great, but what about years 3-4
when it vests out?

Ask:
"Can you share what typical refresher grants look like for
this level? I want to understand the long-term compensation
trajectory."

Better ask:
"Would it be possible to include a minimum refresher grant
guarantee in my offer letter for year 2?"

Why this works:
- Shows you're thinking long-term
- Very few candidates ask this
- Demonstrates understanding of equity compensation
```

### 5. The Remote Work Premium

```markdown
Scenario: They want you in office, you want remote

Option A: Negotiate remote + lower salary
Option B: Negotiate remote + same salary
Option C: Negotiate hybrid + same salary

Approach:
"I'm most productive working remotely, which I've demonstrated
at my current role. I understand there may be a salary
adjustment for remote positions. What's the comp difference
between on-site and remote for this role?"

Then negotiate:
"Given that I'll save the company [office costs / relocation],
would you consider keeping the compensation the same for remote?"
```

---

## Negotiation Scripts by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Startup Offer vs FAANG Offer

```markdown
Startup Offer:
- Base: $150K
- Equity: 0.5% (potentially worth $0-$5M+ if IPO)
- Signing: $20K
- Current valuation: $200M
- TC (today): $220K
- TC (if $1B exit): $5.22M

FAANG Offer:
- Base: $180K
- Equity: $400K/4 years = $100K/year
- Signing: $40K
- Bonus: $27K
- TC (Year 1): $347K
- TC (4 years): $1.12M

Your script:
"[Startup], I have a FAANG offer at $347K in Year 1. I'm
excited about your mission and growth potential, but the
guaranteed compensation gap is significant. Can we discuss
either:
1. Increasing equity to [0.75-1%], or
2. Increasing base to [$170K], or
3. Larger signing bonus [$50K] to offset the risk?"
```

### Scenario 2: Internal Transfer Negotiation

```markdown
Current role: DevOps Engineer (L4)
New role: Senior DevOps Engineer (L5) on different team

Mistake: Assuming internal transfers don't get raises

Correct approach:
"I'm excited about the L5 opportunity. What's the compensation
package for this role? I want to make sure it aligns with
external L5 market rates [$320K-$360K total comp]."

Why: Internal transfers often CAN negotiate, especially for
level changes. Don't leave money on the table!
```

### Scenario 3: Negotiating After a Lowball Offer

```markdown
Expected: $250K TC
Received: $180K TC

Don't: Get angry or emotional

Do:
"Thanks for the offer. I want to be transparent - based on
[market data / my experience / competing offers], I was
expecting total compensation in the $240-270K range. The
current offer is significantly below that. Is there substantial
room to move on the compensation package?"

If they say no or minimal movement:
"I appreciate your time, but this gap is too large for me to
bridge. If circumstances change or you're able to go back to
the team, I'd be happy to reconsider."

Then: Walk away. Lowball offers often mean they'll undervalue
you throughout your tenure.
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Accepting Too Quickly
```
"Wow, $200K! I accept!"

Problem: Left money on the table
Better: "Thank you! Let me review the written offer and get
back to you in a few days."
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Revealing Current Salary
```
"I currently make $120K"

Problem: Anchored negotiation to your current (lower) salary
Better: "I'm focused on the market rate for this role, which
based on my research is $160-180K."
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Negotiating Only Base
```
"Can you go from $150K to $160K base?"

Problem: Missed 70% of total comp (equity, bonus, signing)
Better: "Can we discuss total compensation? I'm targeting
$300K total comp across all components."
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Being Aggressive
```
"Your offer is insulting. I need $300K or I walk."

Problem: Burned bridge, ended negotiation
Better: "I appreciate the offer. I was hoping to be in the
$280-320K range based on [reasons]. Is there flexibility?"
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Getting It in Writing
```
"Sure, we can give you that raise after 6 months."

Problem: No guarantee, might not happen
Better: "That sounds great. Can we include that in the offer
letter with the specific criteria for the raise?"
```

### ❌ Mistake 6: Comparing Pre-tax Comp
```
"$200K in Texas is better than $250K in California"

Problem: Incomplete analysis
Better: Compare after-tax, after-cost-of-living numbers
```

### ❌ Mistake 7: Negotiating Via Text/Slack
```
Use: Phone call or video > Email > Text (never)

Why: Phone allows for nuance, rapport, real-time discussion
```

## The Negotiation Mindset

### Shift Your Thinking

**From: "I'm asking for a favor"**
To: "We're finding a mutually beneficial agreement"

**From: "They might get mad and rescind"**
To: "Professional negotiation is expected and respected"

**From: "I should be grateful for any offer"**
To: "I'm bringing significant value and should be compensated fairly"

**From: "I don't want to seem greedy"**
To: "Advocating for myself is professional and necessary"

### Building Leverage

```markdown
Leverage comes from:
1. ✅ Multiple offers (strongest)
2. ✅ Rare/in-demand skills
3. ✅ Being a top performer at current company
4. ✅ Being willing to walk away
5. ✅ Not needing the job immediately
6. ✅ Strong interview performance
7. ✅ Market conditions (high demand for DevOps)

You need 2-3 of these to negotiate effectively.
```

---

## After You Accept

### 1. Give Notice Professionally

```markdown
Meeting with manager (in person if possible):

"Hi [Manager], I wanted to let you know that I've accepted
a new opportunity. My last day will be [2-4 weeks from now].
I'm grateful for everything I've learned here, and I want to
ensure a smooth transition."

Don't:
❌ Tell them where you're going (unless you want to)
❌ Say anything negative
❌ Brag about your new salary
❌ Get emotional

Do:
✅ Be professional
✅ Offer to document your work
✅ Offer to train replacement
✅ Stay positive
```

### 2. Handle Counter-offers Carefully

```markdown
Current company: "We'll match the offer! $250K to stay!"

⚠️ Warning: 70% of people who accept counter-offers leave
within 12 months anyway

Questions to ask yourself:
- Why did it take me leaving to get paid fairly?
- Will I be first on the layoff list (disloyal)?
- Are the reasons I wanted to leave still there?
- Is this just delaying the inevitable?

When to accept counter-offer:
✅ You were only leaving for money
✅ You love the team/work
✅ The company culture is great
✅ They address ALL your concerns (not just money)

When to decline:
✅ You were leaving for career growth
✅ You were leaving for culture/team issues
✅ You've already mentally checked out
✅ Your new opportunity is significantly better
```

### 3. Verify Your Offer Details

```markdown
Before your start date, confirm in writing:

☐ Start date
☐ Base salary (per year, paid bi-weekly/monthly)
☐ Equity grant details (# of shares/RSUs, vesting schedule)
☐ Signing bonus (amount, payment date, clawback terms)
☐ Target bonus percentage
☐ Benefits start date
☐ Relocation package (if applicable)
☐ Remote work agreement
☐ Equipment provided
☐ PTO accrual
☐ 401k match details

If anything is wrong: Speak up NOW, before you give notice
```
