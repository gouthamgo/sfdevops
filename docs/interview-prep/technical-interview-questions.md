## Category 1: Git and Version Control

### Q1: What's the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Merge combines branches, rebase also combines branches."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "`git merge` creates a new merge commit that combines two branches, preserving the full history of both. It's non-destructive—all commits remain exactly as they were. If I merge feature into main, I get a commit that says 'Merged feature into main' with two parent commits.
>
> `git rebase` replays your commits on top of another branch, rewriting history. It creates new commits with different hashes. The result is a linear history that looks like your feature was developed on the latest main, even if it wasn't.
>
> I'd use merge when working on shared branches or when I want to preserve the exact history for audit purposes. I'd use rebase for cleaning up my local feature branch before creating a merge request, making the history easier to read. But never rebase commits that have been pushed to shared branches—that forces everyone to re-clone."

**Why It's Strong**: Shows deep understanding of both commands, explains trade-offs, and gives practical guidance on when to use each.

---

### Q2: How do you resolve a merge conflict?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "You open the file and fix the conflict."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "When Git encounters a merge conflict, it marks the conflicted sections with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers. I'd first run `git status` to see which files are in conflict.
>
> Then I'd open each file and look at both versions. The section between `<<<` and `===` is my current branch, and between `===` and `>>>` is the incoming branch. I need to understand what each developer was trying to accomplish—often I'll talk to them directly if the change is complex.
>
> For Salesforce metadata conflicts, it's usually adding different methods to the same class, so I keep both changes. If they modified the same method, I need to combine the logic carefully.
>
> After manually resolving, I remove the conflict markers, save the file, and run `git add <file>` to mark it as resolved. Then `git commit` to complete the merge. Critically, I'd run all Apex tests and deploy to a Dev org to verify the merged code actually works—Git doesn't understand Salesforce logic, so manual verification is essential."

**Why It's Strong**: Provides step-by-step process, acknowledges the need for human judgment, and includes Salesforce-specific considerations.

---

### Q3: Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Pull gets the code from remote, fetch also gets the code."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "`git fetch` downloads commits from the remote repository but doesn't merge them into your current branch. It updates your remote-tracking branches (like `origin/main`) so you can see what others have done, but your local `main` stays unchanged. It's safe and non-destructive.
>
> `git pull` is actually `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. It downloads AND merges in one command. If there are conflicts, you'll have to resolve them immediately.
>
> I prefer `git fetch` in my daily workflow because it lets me review changes before merging. I can run `git fetch`, then `git log origin/main` to see what commits others added, and `git diff main origin/main` to see the actual changes. Then I decide when to merge with `git merge origin/main`.
>
> `git pull` is convenient for simple updates when I'm confident there won't be conflicts, like pulling main first thing in the morning when I haven't made local changes yet."

**Why It's Strong**: Explains the technical difference, shows a thoughtful workflow, and explains when each is appropriate.

---

### Q4: How would you undo a commit that was already pushed to the remote repository?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Use `git reset --hard` and force push."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "It depends on whether others have already pulled that commit. If I'm the only one who's pulled it, I could use `git reset --hard HEAD~1` locally and `git push --force`, but force pushing is dangerous because it rewrites history and can lose other people's work.
>
> The safer approach is `git revert HEAD`, which creates a new commit that undoes the changes. This preserves history and doesn't require force pushing. If the bad commit is `abc123`, I'd run `git revert abc123`, which creates a new commit that does the opposite of what abc123 did.
>
> For example, if abc123 added a file, revert would delete it. This maintains the audit trail—anyone can see that a mistake was made and then corrected.
>
> If the commit contains sensitive data like credentials, that's an emergency. I'd notify the team, force push the removal, rotate the credentials immediately, and have everyone re-clone the repository. But for normal mistakes, revert is the professional approach."

**Why It's Strong**: Acknowledges different scenarios, prioritizes safety, and includes the special case of sensitive data.

---

### Q5: What's your branching strategy for a large team with scheduled releases?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "We use feature branches."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "For a large team with scheduled releases like Australia Post, I'd recommend Environment-Based Branching combined with GitFlow principles.
>
> We'd have three long-lived branches: `integration`, `uat`, and `production`, matching our Salesforce sandbox structure. Developers create feature branches from integration using the naming convention `feature/JIRA-123-description`.
>
> The promotion path is: features merge to integration → integration merges to UAT → UAT merges to production. Each merge point is an approval gate: integration requires technical review, UAT requires business approval, production requires manager sign-off.
>
> For hotfixes, I'd use GitFlow's approach: branch from production, fix, merge back to production AND integration to keep them in sync. Every production merge gets tagged with a version number.
>
> This approach gives us the audit trail needed for compliance, supports monthly release coordination through the UAT branch, and mirrors the way Salesforce orgs actually work, making it intuitive for developers to understand."

**Why It's Strong**: Tailored to the specific context (Australia Post), explains the complete workflow, and justifies the choice with business reasons.

---

## Category 2: Salesforce Deployment

### Q6: What's the difference between Metadata API and Tooling API?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Metadata API is for metadata, Tooling API is for tools."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Metadata API is designed for full deployments—moving complete components between orgs. It works asynchronously, handles all metadata types, and is what SFDX uses under the hood for deployments. When I run `sf project deploy start`, it's using Metadata API. It creates a deployment package, validates it, runs tests, and deploys everything atomically.
>
> Tooling API is designed for development tools and smaller, synchronous operations. It's faster for individual metadata changes and provides more detailed information about components. IDEs like VS Code use it for real-time syntax checking and code completion.
>
> Metadata API can deploy a trigger with all its dependencies; Tooling API is better for querying information about that trigger or making a quick edit.
>
> In a DevOps context, I'd use Metadata API for CI/CD deployments and Tooling API for development-time operations like retrieving code coverage data or analyzing dependencies."

**Why It's Strong**: Explains the use case for each, provides concrete examples, and connects to real DevOps work.

---

### Q7: How do you handle deployment failures due to missing dependencies?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "I add the missing component and redeploy."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Dependency failures happen when you're deploying a component that references something that doesn't exist in the target org. For example, deploying a page layout that references a field that hasn't been deployed yet.
>
> My first step is to read the error message carefully—Salesforce usually tells you exactly what's missing: 'In field: Account.Custom_Field__c - no CustomField named Account.Custom_Field__c found.'
>
> I'd update my deployment package to include the dependency. If I'm using a manifest file (package.xml), I'd add the missing metadata type. If using source-tracked deployment, I'd include the dependency folder.
>
> To prevent this proactively, I'd:
> 1. Use `sf project retrieve start --manifest package.xml` to pull all dependencies explicitly
> 2. Deploy in logical order: fields before page layouts, classes before triggers
> 3. Use Salesforce DX source tracking which handles dependencies automatically
> 4. Run validation deployments (`--dry-run`) before actual deployment
>
> In our CI/CD pipeline, I'd build a dependency checker that analyzes metadata relationships and orders deployments correctly."

**Why It's Strong**: Shows troubleshooting process, preventive measures, and automation thinking.

---

### Q8: Explain the difference between source format and metadata format

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Source format is newer."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Metadata format is the original Salesforce structure using `package.xml` and bulk XML files. A custom object would be one giant XML file with all fields, validation rules, and record types combined. It's not Git-friendly because multiple developers editing different fields still modify the same file, causing merge conflicts.
>
> Source format, introduced with Salesforce DX, breaks metadata into smaller, granular files organized in a directory structure. The same custom object becomes a folder with separate files for each field, each validation rule, each record type. This is much more Git-friendly—two developers can modify different fields without conflicts.
>
> For example:
> - Metadata format: `Account.object` (one 500-line file)
> - Source format: `objects/Account/fields/Revenue__c.field-meta.xml` (50 lines)
>
> Source format also aligns with scratch org development and is required for Salesforce DX projects. I'd always use source format for new projects because it enables proper version control and team collaboration.
>
> The `sf project convert` commands can convert between formats when needed for legacy integrations."

**Why It's Strong**: Explains the practical impact on team collaboration, provides concrete examples, and gives guidance on when to use each.

---

### Q9: How do you handle test failures during deployment?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "I fix the failing test and redeploy."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "First, I need to understand WHY the test is failing. I'd look at the deployment logs to see the specific test and error message. Common reasons include:
> - Test data setup issues (hardcoded IDs, references to missing records)
> - Governor limit failures (SOQL in loops, too many queries)
> - Org-specific data that doesn't exist in the target (record types, users)
> - Time-based logic (tests that depend on current date)
>
> If it's a genuine bug that my code introduced, I'd fix the bug locally, update the test if needed, commit, and redeploy.
>
> If it's an existing test that's flaky or environment-specific, I have options:
> 1. Fix the test to be more robust (better data setup, use @TestSetup)
> 2. If it's a known issue, deploy with `--test-level RunLocalTests` to run only local tests
> 3. Never skip tests entirely—that's dangerous
>
> In our CI/CD pipeline, I'd configure it to fail the deployment if tests fail, email the developer, and require fixing before allowing merge. Tests are the safety net; bypassing them defeats the purpose of automation."

**Why It's Strong**: Shows systematic troubleshooting, acknowledges different scenarios, and emphasizes testing importance.

---

### Q10: What's destructive deployment and when would you use it?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "It deletes things."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Destructive deployment removes metadata from the target org—deleting fields, classes, or other components. Unlike regular deployment which only adds or updates, destructive deployment explicitly removes.
>
> You specify what to delete in `destructiveChangesPost.xml` (delete after deployment) or `destructiveChangesPre.xml` (delete before deployment). For example, to remove an obsolete field:
>
> ```xml
> <types>
>   <name>CustomField</name>
>   <members>Account.Old_Field__c</members>
> </types>
> ```
>
> I'd use destructive deployment when:
> - Removing deprecated fields after migration
> - Cleaning up obsolete code
> - Renaming components (delete old, deploy new)
>
> Critical considerations:
> 1. You can't delete metadata that's referenced elsewhere (field used in page layout)
> 2. Some metadata can't be deleted via API (certain standard objects)
> 3. Always test in sandbox first
> 4. Communicate with the team—destructive changes affect everyone
> 5. Back up data if deleting fields with data
>
> In practice, I'd document every destructive change in the merge request and require explicit approval before deploying to production."

**Why It's Strong**: Explains the technical mechanism, provides use cases, and emphasizes safety considerations.

## Category 3: CI/CD Pipelines

### Q11: Walk me through designing a CI/CD pipeline for Salesforce from scratch

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "You set up GitLab to deploy to Salesforce when you push code."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "I'd design a multi-stage pipeline with clear separation between testing, validation, and deployment.
>
> **Stage 1: Build** - Validate metadata structure
> - Check metadata syntax
> - Validate package.xml
> - Run static code analysis (PMD, ESLint for LWC)
>
> **Stage 2: Test** - Automated testing
> - Authenticate to target org
> - Deploy with `--dry-run` (validation only)
> - Run all Apex tests with `--test-level RunLocalTests`
> - Check coverage meets 75% minimum
> - Fail pipeline if any test fails
>
> **Stage 3: Deploy to Dev** - After merge to main
> - Deploy to Dev sandbox
> - Run smoke tests (can create account, can create opportunity)
> - Notification to team Slack channel
>
> **Stage 4: Deploy to Integration** - Automatic
> - Merge to integration branch triggers deployment
> - Deploy to Integration sandbox
> - Run full test suite
> - Update deployment dashboard
>
> **Stage 5: Deploy to UAT** - Manual gate
> - Requires approval in GitLab
> - Deploy to UAT sandbox
> - Business user testing
>
> **Stage 6: Deploy to Production** - Manual gate + schedule
> - Requires manager approval
> - Scheduled for off-hours deployment window
> - Backup production metadata first
> - Deploy to production
> - Run production smoke tests
> - Automated rollback on failure
> - Send deployment report
>
> Each stage has timeout limits and failure handling. Logs stored for audit. Credentials stored in GitLab CI/CD variables, never in code."

**Why It's Strong**: Shows systematic thinking, includes testing and validation, addresses security, and provides complete lifecycle.

### Q12: How do you store Salesforce credentials securely in a CI/CD pipeline?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Put them in environment variables."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Never store credentials in code or commit them to Git. For CI/CD, I'd use several approaches depending on the authentication method:
>
> **Method 1: JWT Bearer Flow** (recommended)
> - Generate a certificate and private key
> - Create a Connected App in Salesforce with the certificate
> - Store the private key in GitLab CI/CD Variables (masked, protected)
> - Pipeline uses `sf org login jwt` with the key
> - No password needed, more secure than username/password
>
> **Method 2: Auth URL**
> - Authenticate locally once: `sf org login web`
> - Export auth URL: `sf org display --target-org ProdOrg --verbose --json`
> - Store the auth URL in GitLab Variables (masked)
> - Pipeline uses `sf org login sfdx-url` with the stored URL
>
> **Method 3: OAuth Web Flow** (for sandboxes)
> - Connected App with OAuth
> - Store refresh token in CI/CD variables
> - Exchange for access token at runtime
>
> **Security best practices**:
> - Rotate credentials every 90 days
> - Use GitLab's masked variables so they don't appear in logs
> - Use protected variables only accessible to protected branches
> - Limit Connected App to specific IP ranges
> - Create a dedicated CI/CD user with minimum permissions
> - Enable MFA for the CI/CD user
> - Monitor API usage for anomalies
>
> Never use admin credentials for automation. Create service accounts with appropriate permission sets."

**Why It's Strong**: Provides multiple methods, explains security considerations, and includes operational best practices.

---

### Q13: How do you handle rollback if a production deployment fails?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Undo the deployment."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Salesforce doesn't have a built-in 'undo' button, so rollback requires planning ahead.
>
> **Automated rollback strategy**:
> 1. Before deployment, retrieve current production state:
>    ```bash
>    sf project retrieve start --manifest package.xml --target-org Production
>    git commit -m 'Backup: Production state before deployment'
>    git tag pre-deployment-backup
>    ```
>
> 2. If deployment fails or causes issues:
>    ```bash
>    git revert HEAD  # Creates commit that undoes the change
>    # Pipeline redeploys the previous version
>    ```
>
> 3. Pipeline detects failure (tests fail, smoke tests fail, health check fails) and automatically:
>    - Stops the deployment
>    - Deploys the backup version
>    - Sends alert to on-call team
>
> **Manual rollback**:
> - Deploy the previous version from Git history
> - Use Quick Deploy for recently validated changes (saves time)
>
> **Limitations**:
> - Can't delete deployed metadata easily (destructive changes required)
> - Custom fields with data can't be deleted without data loss
> - Some changes are one-way (schema changes)
>
> **Best practices to minimize rollback need**:
> - Always validate before deploying (`--dry-run`)
> - Use feature flags to disable problematic features without redeploying
> - Deploy during low-traffic windows
> - Have a rollback plan documented before starting
> - Practice rollback in sandbox to verify it works
>
> At Australia Post, I'd ensure every production deployment has a tested rollback plan approved before the deployment window."

**Why It's Strong**: Provides both automated and manual approaches, acknowledges limitations, and includes preventive measures.

### Q14: What metrics would you track for your CI/CD pipeline?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Number of deployments."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "I'd track metrics across four categories: speed, quality, reliability, and adoption.
>
> **Speed Metrics**:
> - Deployment frequency (how often we deploy)
> - Lead time (commit to production time)
> - Pipeline execution time (how long builds take)
> - Time to restore service (how fast we fix production issues)
>
> **Quality Metrics**:
> - Test pass rate (percentage of successful test runs)
> - Code coverage trend (improving or declining)
> - Deployment failure rate (how often deployments fail)
> - Production incident rate (bugs that reach users)
> - Hotfix frequency (emergency fixes needed)
>
> **Reliability Metrics**:
> - Pipeline uptime (is GitLab available)
> - Flaky test rate (tests that pass/fail inconsistently)
> - Rollback rate (how often we need to roll back)
>
> **Adoption Metrics**:
> - Percentage of changes going through pipeline (vs manual)
> - Number of teams using the pipeline
> - Manual change requests (should decrease over time)
>
> **Dashboard example**:
> - Deployment success rate: 94% (last 30 days)
> - Average deployment time: 8 minutes
> - Test coverage: 78% (up from 72% last quarter)
> - Mean time to recovery: 22 minutes
>
> I'd share these metrics in monthly reviews to demonstrate ROI of DevOps investment and identify areas for improvement. If deployment time increases, we need to optimize. If test coverage drops, we need to enforce standards."

**Why It's Strong**: Comprehensive metrics, organized by category, includes actionable insights, shows business awareness.

---

### Q15: How do you handle concurrent deployments from multiple teams?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "We don't deploy at the same time."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "With multiple teams, we need deployment orchestration to prevent conflicts.
>
> **Approach 1: Feature Branch Isolation**
> - Each team works on feature branches
> - All features merge to integration sandbox first
> - Integration sandbox shows combined changes
> - Conflicts discovered early, before production
>
> **Approach 2: Deployment Locks**
> - Implement deployment queue in CI/CD pipeline
> - Only one production deployment at a time
> - Use GitLab's resource locking or custom mutex
> - Teams see queue status: 'Deployment in progress, position in queue: 2'
>
> **Approach 3: Deployment Windows**
> - Production deploys only during defined windows (Tue/Thu 11 PM)
> - Teams coordinate their merges to hit the window
> - Emergency hotfixes bypass windows with approval
>
> **Approach 4: Environment-Specific Pipelines**
> - Integration deploys automatically (no lock needed)
> - UAT deploys require coordination (shared calendar)
> - Production has strict windows and approval gates
>
> **Communication**:
> - Slack channel: #deployments
> - Automated messages: 'Team A deploying to UAT, ETA 10 minutes'
> - Deployment calendar visible to all
> - Post-deployment: 'Production deployment complete, smoke tests passed'
>
> At Australia Post with 5 teams, I'd use deployment locks for production combined with environment-based branching. Integration sandbox allows parallel development without coordination, but production requires orchestration for safety."

**Why It's Strong**: Multiple strategies provided, acknowledges team scale considerations, includes communication aspects.

## Category 4: Troubleshooting and Production Issues

### Q16: Production is down. Users can't log in. Walk me through your troubleshooting process.

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Check the logs."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "This is a P0 incident requiring immediate action.
>
> **First 60 seconds - Assess and communicate**:
> 1. Confirm the issue: Can I log in? Check status.salesforce.com for platform issues
> 2. Acknowledge in incident channel: 'P0: Login failure, investigating'
> 3. Check scope: All users or specific profiles? Specific browser? Mobile too?
>
> **Minutes 1-5 - Quick wins**:
> 1. Recent changes: Check deployment logs—was anything deployed recently?
>    ```bash
>    git log --since='2 hours ago' --oneline
>    ```
> 2. Check Salesforce Setup Audit Trail for configuration changes
> 3. Check Login History: Are login attempts being logged?
> 4. Check identity provider if using SSO (Okta, Azure AD)
>
> **Minutes 5-15 - Deep diagnosis**:
> 1. Debug logs: Enable for a test user, attempt login, check logs
> 2. Login Flow: Is there a custom login flow causing issues?
> 3. Permission sets: Were user permissions changed?
> 4. License issues: Are Salesforce licenses expired?
> 5. Network: IP restrictions blocking users?
>
> **Immediate fix**:
> - If recent deployment caused it: Rollback immediately
> - If configuration change: Revert through Setup
> - If SSO issue: Switch to Salesforce authentication temporarily
>
> **Communication every 5 minutes**:
> - 'Update: Identified recent deployment as cause, rolling back'
> - 'Update: Rollback complete, users can retry login'
> - 'Update: Confirmed resolution, 200 users logged in successfully'
>
> **Post-incident**:
> - Write postmortem documenting root cause and prevention
> - Add monitoring for this scenario
> - Update runbook with this troubleshooting flow
>
> Total time to restore service: Target under 30 minutes."

**Why It's Strong**: Systematic approach, time-bounded, includes communication, shows incident management experience.

### Q17: How do you debug a governor limit exception in production?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Look at which limit was hit."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Governor limit exceptions in production are tricky because you can't just add debug statements and redeploy—that takes time and users are affected now.
>
> **Immediate troubleshooting**:
> 1. Check the error logs to identify which limit:
>    - SOQL queries (101 limit)
>    - DML statements (150 limit)
>    - CPU time (10,000ms)
>    - Heap size (6MB)
>
> 2. Enable debug logs for the affected user:
>    - Setup → Debug Logs → New
>    - Set to FINEST for Apex Code
>    - Reproduce the issue
>    - Download log and search for 'LIMIT_USAGE'
>
> 3. Analyze the log:
>    - Find where limits are accumulating
>    - Look for SOQL in loops
>    - Check for inefficient queries
>    - Identify trigger recursion
>
> **Common patterns and fixes**:
>
> **SOQL in loop**:
> ```apex
> // Bad
> for (Opportunity opp : opps) {
>     Account a = [SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Id = :opp.AccountId];
> }
>
> // Fixed
> Map<Id, Account> accountMap = new Map<Id, Account>(
>     [SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds]
> );
> ```
>
> **CPU time**:
> - Complex formulas in loop
> - Excessive string manipulation
> - Large data sets processed in memory
>
> **Immediate mitigation**:
> - If it's affecting all users: Deactivate the trigger/class temporarily
> - If specific to bulk operation: Add batch processing
> - If data-specific: Identify and fix the problematic records
>
> **Long-term fix**:
> - Bulkify the code
> - Add unit tests with 200 records to catch this in CI/CD
> - Code review focusing on governor limits
>
> In the interview, I'd walk through a specific example from my experience if I had one."

**Why It's Strong**: Detailed troubleshooting steps, shows understanding of governor limits, provides code examples, includes prevention.

### Q18: You deployed a change that's causing performance degradation. How do you identify which change?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Check what was in the deployment."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Performance degradation after deployment requires isolating the problematic change.
>
> **Step 1: Identify the deployment** (2 minutes)
> ```bash
> git log --since='2 hours ago' --oneline
> # Shows recent commits
>
> git show <commit-hash>
> # See exactly what changed
> ```
>
> **Step 2: Review the change components** (5 minutes)
> - Which metadata was deployed?
> - Triggers? (common culprit—they run on every transaction)
> - Validation rules? (evaluated on every save)
> - Flows? (process automation overhead)
> - SOQL queries? (inefficient queries slow everything down)
>
> **Step 3: Use Salesforce tools** (10 minutes)
> - Event Monitoring: Check performance metrics before/after deployment
> - Query plan tool: Analyze slow SOQL queries
> - Debug logs: Enable for affected transactions
> - Look for:
>   - Queries taking >1000ms
>   - CPU time spikes
>   - Increased DML operations
>
> **Step 4: Isolate the component** (15 minutes)
> - If deployment had 5 Apex classes, which one is slow?
> - Deactivate components one at a time (in Dev sandbox first)
> - Test performance after each deactivation
> - The one that improves performance is your culprit
>
> **Step 5: Fix or rollback** (30 minutes)
> - Quick fix possible? Deploy patch
> - Complex fix needed? Rollback deployment, fix offline, redeploy
>
> **Example scenario**:
> 'We deployed an AccountTrigger that queries related Opportunities on every Account update. In production, bulk Account updates from data loader are now taking 10 minutes instead of 1 minute. The trigger queries in a loop instead of bulkifying. Immediate fix: Deactivate trigger. Proper fix: Bulkify the query, add test with 200 records, redeploy.'
>
> **Prevention**:
> - Load testing before production deployment
> - Monitor performance metrics in CI/CD pipeline
> - Code review specifically checking for performance anti-patterns"

**Why It's Strong**: Systematic debugging process, uses actual Salesforce tools, provides concrete example, includes prevention strategy.

### Q19: How do you handle a situation where tests pass in sandbox but fail in production?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Run the tests again."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "This indicates an environment-specific issue—something exists in production that doesn't exist in sandbox, or vice versa.
>
> **Common causes**:
>
> **1. Org-specific data**
> - Production has record types that sandbox doesn't
> - Users exist in prod but not sandbox
> - Profiles or permission sets configured differently
> - Custom settings with different values
>
> **2. Data volume**
> - Production has millions of records, sandbox is smaller
> - Queries that work in sandbox hit limits in production
>
> **3. Time-based logic**
> - Tests using `Date.today()` behave differently on different run dates
> - Business hours calculations
> - Scheduled jobs running in background
>
> **4. Integration differences**
> - External APIs behave differently
> - Callout URLs point to different endpoints
> - Authentication differences
>
> **Troubleshooting approach**:
>
> 1. **Get the exact error**:
>    - Run the specific test in production (Apex Test Execution)
>    - Capture the full stack trace
>
> 2. **Compare environments**:
>    ```bash
>    # Retrieve metadata from both
>    sf project retrieve start --target-org Production
>    sf project retrieve start --target-org Sandbox
>
>    # Compare
>    diff -r prod-metadata sandbox-metadata
>    ```
>
> 3. **Reproduce locally**:
>    - Create scratch org with production-like data
>    - Run test
>    - If it fails, you can debug
>
> 4. **Fix the test**:
>    - Use `@TestSetup` to create all needed data
>    - Don't rely on existing org data
>    - Mock external callouts
>    - Use relative dates (`Date.today().addDays(7)`)
>
> **Example fix**:
> ```apex
> // Bad - assumes record type exists
> RecordType rt = [SELECT Id FROM RecordType WHERE Name = 'Enterprise'];
>
> // Good - creates it in test
> @TestSetup
> static void setup() {
>     RecordType rt = new RecordType(Name = 'Enterprise', SObjectType = 'Account');
>     insert rt;
> }
> ```
>
> **Immediate workaround**:
> - If deployment is urgent and test isn't critical: Deploy without that specific test (risky!)
> - Better: Fix test, deploy to sandbox, verify it passes, then deploy to production"

**Why It's Strong**: Identifies multiple root causes, provides systematic diagnosis, shows understanding of test isolation principles.

### Q20: Describe your approach to monitoring production after deployment

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Check if users report issues."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Proactive monitoring catches issues before users do. I'd implement multiple layers of monitoring post-deployment.
>
> **Immediate post-deployment (first 30 minutes)**:
>
> **1. Smoke tests** (automated):
> ```bash
> # Run critical path tests
> - Can users log in?
> - Can users create an Account?
> - Can users create an Opportunity?
> - Can users view a report?
> - Does the homepage load?
> ```
>
> **2. Error monitoring**:
> - Check Apex exception emails (first 10 minutes are critical)
> - Monitor debug logs for new errors
> - Check failed API calls
>
> **3. Performance baseline**:
> - Compare page load times to pre-deployment baseline
> - Check API response times
> - Monitor Salesforce Event Monitoring for slow queries
>
> **Ongoing monitoring (first 24 hours)**:
>
> **4. User activity patterns**:
> - Login rate (should be normal)
> - Transaction volume (unexpected drop indicates problems)
> - Support ticket volume (spike indicates user issues)
>
> **5. Automated alerts**:
> - Set up alerts in Event Monitoring for:
>   - Error rate > 1% (normally 0.1%)
>   - Query time > 2 seconds
>   - CPU time exceptions
> - Slack notifications: '#production-alerts'
>
> **6. Business metrics**:
> - Opportunities created (should match historical average)
> - Cases created
> - Orders processed
> - Any drop indicates functionality broken
>
> **Dashboard example**:
> ```
> Production Health - Last 24 Hours
> --------------------------------
> ✅ Deployments: 1 (successful)
> ✅ Error rate: 0.08%
> ✅ Avg response time: 1.2s
> ✅ Failed logins: 3 (normal)
> ⚠️  Slow queries: 12 (up from 5)
> ✅ Support tickets: 34 (normal)
> ```
>
> **Rollback trigger**:
> If within first hour I see:
> - Error rate > 5%
> - 10+ support tickets about same issue
> - Critical functionality broken
> → Immediately rollback, investigate offline
>
> **Communication**:
> - Post in #deployments: 'Production deployment monitoring: All green 30 minutes post-deploy'
> - After 24 hours: 'Production stable, deployment successful, no rollback needed'
>
> This monitoring approach has caught subtle bugs within minutes rather than waiting for user reports hours later."

**Why It's Strong**: Multi-layered approach, specific metrics, includes automation, defines rollback criteria, shows real operational experience.

## Category 5: Architecture and Best Practices

### Q21: How would you architect a deployment pipeline for an organization with 100+ developers?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Use a big pipeline with lots of stages."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "At that scale, you need modularity, governance, and self-service capabilities.
>
> **Architecture components**:
>
> **1. Multi-track pipelines**:
> - Standard pipeline: Full testing, 30-minute deployment
> - Fast-track pipeline: Critical hotfixes, 10-minute deployment
> - Scheduled pipeline: Overnight batch for non-urgent changes
>
> **2. Monorepo vs multi-repo strategy**:
> - Option A: Monorepo with all Salesforce metadata
>   - Pros: Single source of truth, easier dependency management
>   - Cons: Large codebase, harder to manage permissions
> - Option B: Multiple repos by team/product
>   - Pros: Team autonomy, faster builds
>   - Cons: Dependency hell, harder to coordinate
>
> For Australia Post with 5 distinct teams (Sales, Service, Community, Marketing, Platform), I'd recommend **monorepo with directory-based permissions**:
> ```
> salesforce-crm/
>   ├── sales-cloud/       (Sales team owns)
>   ├── service-cloud/     (Service team owns)
>   ├── community/         (Community team owns)
>   ├── shared/            (Platform team owns)
>   └── .gitlab-ci.yml     (Shared pipeline)
> ```
>
> **3. Pipeline stages for scale**:
>
> **Stage 1: Validate** (runs on every commit, any branch)
> - Syntax checking
> - Linting
> - Unit tests for changed components only
> - Fast: 3-5 minutes
>
> **Stage 2: Full test** (runs on merge to main)
> - All Apex tests
> - Integration tests
> - Security scan (PMD, Checkmarx)
> - 10-15 minutes
>
> **Stage 3: Deploy to dev environments** (automatic)
> - Each team has their own dev sandbox
> - Parallel deployments
>
> **Stage 4: Integration** (daily scheduled merge)
> - Merge all team branches to integration
> - Deploy to shared Integration sandbox
> - Integration tests across modules
>
> **Stage 5: UAT/Production** (gated, scheduled)
> - Require approvals from tech leads
> - Deploy during maintenance windows
> - Staged rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
>
> **4. Governance**:
> - Branch protection: No direct commits to main
> - Required reviewers: 2 approvals for production
> - CODEOWNERS file: Auto-assign reviewers by directory
> - Dependency scanning: Prevent breaking changes
>
> **5. Self-service tooling**:
> - CLI tool: `deploy --env uat --component ApexClass`
> - Dashboard: View deployment queue, status, history
> - Documentation: Runbooks for common scenarios
>
> **6. Performance optimization**:
> - Parallel test execution (split by class)
> - Incremental deployments (only changed components)
> - Caching: node_modules, SFDX cache
> - CDN for artifacts
>
> This architecture would handle 100+ developers with minimal friction while maintaining quality gates."

**Why It's Strong**: Addresses scale concerns, provides concrete structure, includes governance, shows trade-off thinking, specific to the context.

### Q22: What's your approach to managing technical debt in a DevOps environment?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Fix it when we have time."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Technical debt compounds, so it needs systematic management, not ad-hoc fixes.
>
> **Identification**:
>
> **1. Automated detection**:
> - Static code analysis (PMD for Apex, ESLint for JavaScript)
> - Code coverage trends (if declining, debt accumulating)
> - Complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity > 15 needs refactoring)
> - Dependency analysis (outdated packages)
>
> **2. Manual review**:
> - Code smells during reviews (large classes, duplicated code)
> - Deployment pain points (this component always causes conflicts)
> - Performance issues (this trigger is always slow)
>
> **Tracking**:
>
> **3. Debt backlog**:
> - Create Jira tickets tagged 'tech-debt'
> - Prioritize using impact/effort matrix:
>   - High impact, low effort: Do immediately
>   - High impact, high effort: Schedule in sprint
>   - Low impact, low effort: Do during slack time
>   - Low impact, high effort: Consider not doing
>
> **4. Debt dashboard**:
> ```
> Technical Debt Metrics:
> - Total debt items: 47
> - Critical: 8 (blocking new features)
> - High: 15 (causing frequent issues)
> - Medium: 18 (annoying but manageable)
> - Low: 6 (nice to have)
>
> Trend: Added 12 items this quarter, resolved 8 (net +4)
> ```
>
> **Allocation**:
>
> **5. 20% rule**:
> - Every sprint, 20% of capacity goes to tech debt
> - Not negotiable—debt is not optional
> - Prevents accumulation
>
> **6. Debt sprints**:
> - Quarterly dedicated sprint for large refactoring
> - No new features, only debt reduction
>
> **Prevention**:
>
> **7. Quality gates in CI/CD**:
> ```yaml
> code_quality:
>   script:
>     - pmd-scan
>     - complexity-check
>   allow_failure: false  # Fail pipeline if quality drops
> ```
>
> **8. Definition of Done**:
> - Code reviewed
> - Tests written (coverage ≥ 80%)
> - Documentation updated
> - No PMD violations
> - Complexity < 15
>
> **9. Refactoring as part of features**:
> - Boy Scout Rule: Leave code better than you found it
> - Touching old code? Refactor while you're there
>
> **Example**:
> 'Our OpportunityTrigger had 800 lines with cyclomatic complexity of 35. During Quarterly Debt Sprint, we extracted logic into handler classes (OpportunityValidation, OpportunityScoring), reduced complexity to 8, increased coverage from 72% to 89%, and reduced deployment time by 40% because tests run faster. Took 3 days but prevented 6 months of compounding pain.'
>
> Tech debt is like financial debt—managed carefully it's a tool, ignored it's bankruptcy."

**Why It's Strong**: Systematic approach, includes measurement, shows prevention thinking, provides concrete example with metrics.

### Q23: How do you ensure code quality across multiple teams with different skill levels?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Do code reviews."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Code quality requires automated enforcement plus human judgment. You can't rely solely on manual review at scale.
>
> **Tier 1: Automated enforcement** (catches 80% of issues)
>
> **1. CI/CD quality gates**:
> ```yaml
> quality_check:
>   script:
>     - pmd-scan --ruleset apex-ruleset.xml
>     - eslint force-app/lwc/
>     - sfdx scanner:run --target "force-app/**/*.cls"
>   allow_failure: false  # Blocks merge if fails
> ```
>
> **2. Required checks before merge**:
> - All tests pass
> - Coverage ≥ 75% (configurable per team)
> - No PMD priority 1 violations
> - No security vulnerabilities
> - No hardcoded credentials
>
> **3. Pre-commit hooks**:
> - Prevent committing debug statements
> - Format code automatically (Prettier)
> - Check for secrets (git-secrets)
>
> **Tier 2: Structured code review** (catches complexity issues)
>
> **4. Review checklist**:
> ```markdown
> ## Code Review Checklist
> - [ ] Business logic is correct
> - [ ] Bulkified for 200 records
> - [ ] No SOQL in loops
> - [ ] Proper error handling
> - [ ] Tests cover edge cases
> - [ ] Security: FLS/CRUD checks
> - [ ] Comments explain WHY, not WHAT
> - [ ] Follows naming conventions
> ```
>
> **5. Required reviewers by complexity**:
> - Junior dev changes: 1 senior reviewer
> - Senior dev changes: 1 peer reviewer
> - Architecture changes: 2 reviewers + tech lead
> - Security-sensitive: Security team review
>
> **Tier 3: Knowledge sharing** (improves over time)
>
> **6. Coding standards document**:
> - Naming conventions (ClassName, variableName, CONSTANT_NAME)
> - File organization (triggers in one folder, handlers in another)
> - Comment standards (Javadoc for public methods)
> - Error handling patterns
>
> **7. Reference implementations**:
> - Template repository: Copy this structure for new features
> - Example trigger with handler pattern
> - Example test class with @TestSetup
>
> **8. Training program**:
> - Monthly lunch-and-learn sessions
> - Pair programming junior with senior
> - Internal wiki with Salesforce best practices
>
> **9. Metrics and visibility**:
> - Team dashboard shows code quality metrics
> - Gamification: Badge for 'Zero PMD violations for 1 month'
> - Celebrate improvements: 'Team B increased coverage from 65% to 82%!'
>
> **Tier 4: Escalation path**
>
> **10. For persistent issues**:
> - 1-on-1 coaching
> - Targeted training on specific weakness
> - Pairing with senior dev for a sprint
>
> **Example implementation**:
> 'At Australia Post, we had a junior team struggling with bulkification. I added a PMD rule that specifically flagged SOQL in loops and made it a blocking failure. First week: 15 violations caught before merge. Added a training session showing bad vs good patterns. Created a reference TriggerHandler with proper bulkification. After 1 month: Violations dropped to 1-2 per week. After 3 months: Near zero. The automation taught the pattern better than manual reviews.'
>
> The goal is to make doing the right thing easier than doing the wrong thing."

**Why It's Strong**: Multi-layered approach, balances automation with human judgment, includes education component, provides success metrics.

### Q24: Explain your strategy for handling Salesforce API version upgrades

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Update to the latest version."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Salesforce API version upgrades require careful planning because new versions can change behavior.
>
> **Understanding API versions**:
> - Each Salesforce release (Spring, Summer, Winter) introduces a new API version
> - Older versions supported for 3 years before deprecation
> - Different components can use different versions:
>   - Apex class: v59.0
>   - Trigger: v58.0
>   - Integration: v60.0
>
> **Assessment phase** (1-2 weeks before upgrade):
>
> **1. Inventory current versions**:
> ```bash
> # Find all API versions in use
> grep -r "apiVersion" force-app/ | sort | uniq
> ```
>
> **2. Review release notes**:
> - Check Salesforce Release Notes for breaking changes
> - Focus on 'Behavior Changes' and 'Deprecated Features'
> - Example: 'SOQL now enforces relationship limits differently in v60'
>
> **3. Impact analysis**:
> - Which components are affected by changes?
> - Do we use deprecated features?
> - What needs testing?
>
> **Testing phase** (2-3 weeks):
>
> **4. Upgrade sandbox first**:
> - Never upgrade production directly
> - Upgrade Dev sandbox to new API version
> - Run full test suite
> - Manual testing of critical paths
>
> **5. Incremental upgrade strategy**:
> ```xml
> <!-- Option A: Update metadata one at a time -->
> <!-- Update least risky classes first -->
> <apiVersion>60.0</apiVersion>
>
> <!-- Option B: Keep most code on old version -->
> <!-- Only upgrade new features -->
> ```
>
> **6. Regression testing**:
> - Run all automated tests
> - User acceptance testing in UAT
> - Load testing (ensure performance doesn't degrade)
>
> **Deployment phase**:
>
> **7. Phased rollout**:
> - Week 1: Deploy to Integration
> - Week 2: Deploy to UAT
> - Week 3: Deploy to Production (during maintenance window)
>
> **8. Rollback plan**:
> - Keep previous version in Git
> - If major issues, revert version in metadata files
> - Redeploy previous version
>
> **Ongoing strategy**:
>
> **9. Version management policy**:
> - New components always use latest version
> - Existing components: Upgrade opportunistically
>   - When making changes anyway, update version
>   - Don't upgrade just for the sake of it
> - Critical security fixes: Upgrade immediately
> - Deprecated warnings: Address before EOL
>
> **10. Automation**:
> ```yaml
> api_version_check:
>   script:
>     - check_deprecated_versions.sh
>   allow_failure: true  # Warning only
> ```
>
> **Example scenario**:
> 'Salesforce deprecated API v40.0 with 6 months notice. I ran an inventory and found 12 Apex classes still on v40. Created tickets to upgrade each during routine maintenance. Upgraded 2-3 per sprint over 3 months. Tested each in Dev before merging. By deprecation date, all code was on v52 or later. No production incidents, smooth transition.'
>
> **Critical principle**: Don't upgrade just to be on the latest version. Upgrade when there's a reason (new features, deprecation deadline, security fix) and always test thoroughly."

**Why It's Strong**: Risk-aware approach, includes assessment and testing, provides rollback plan, shows pragmatic decision-making.

### Q25: How do you balance speed of delivery with code quality?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "We try to do both."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Speed and quality aren't opposites—done right, automation and standards enable both. Here's how I balance them:
>
> **Shift quality left** (catch issues earlier = faster overall)
>
> **1. Pre-commit automation**:
> - Formatting on save (Prettier)
> - Linting errors shown in IDE (VS Code extensions)
> - Pre-commit hooks catch issues before they reach CI/CD
> - Result: Developers fix problems in seconds, not hours
>
> **2. Fast feedback loops**:
> - Unit tests run in < 2 minutes
> - Code review within 4 hours (team SLA)
> - Failed pipeline notifications immediate
> - Result: Developers don't context-switch and lose time
>
> **Right-size quality gates**
>
> **3. Tiered testing strategy**:
> - Critical path (login, create opportunity): 100% coverage, exhaustive tests
> - Important features: 80% coverage, happy path + edge cases
> - Nice-to-have features: 75% coverage, basic validation
> - Not all code needs the same rigor
>
> **4. Risk-based deployment**:
> - Low-risk changes (documentation, comments): Skip some gates
> - Medium-risk (new feature with feature flag): Standard pipeline
> - High-risk (payment processing, data migration): Extra validation
>
> **Automation removes manual bottlenecks**
>
> **5. Parallel execution**:
> - Test suites split across 5 runners: 15 minutes → 3 minutes
> - Multiple developers deploy simultaneously to different environments
> - CI/CD handles coordination, no manual scheduling
>
> **6. Self-service deployment**:
> - Developers merge when ready, pipeline handles deployment
> - No waiting for manual deployment windows (except production)
> - Deployment frequency increased from weekly to daily = faster to users
>
> **Smart shortcuts (not corner-cutting)**
>
> **7. Feature flags**:
> - Deploy incomplete features behind flags
> - Continuous deployment to production, selective enablement
> - Faster deployment, controlled rollout
>
> **8. Incremental delivery**:
> - Release smallest valuable increment
> - Get feedback, iterate
> - Better than building for 3 months then discovering it's wrong
>
> **Measure both**
>
> **9. Metrics dashboard**:
> ```
> Speed metrics:
> - Deployment frequency: 8 per week (was 1)
> - Lead time: 2 days (was 2 weeks)
> - Deployment time: 8 minutes (was 2 hours)
>
> Quality metrics:
> - Production incidents: 2 per month (was 8)
> - Test coverage: 81% (was 68%)
> - Rollback rate: 3% (was 15%)
> ```
>
> **10. Don't sacrifice for urgency**:
> - Hotfix still gets code review (expedited, not skipped)
> - Tests still required (run subset if time-critical)
> - Document what was skipped, create follow-up ticket
>
> **Real example**:
> 'We had pressure to deliver 10 features in 1 sprint—normally we do 5. Instead of cutting corners, I:
> - Implemented feature flags so we could deploy partially done work
> - Parallelized test execution to cut pipeline time by 60%
> - Automated code review checklist items (formatting, linting)
> - Set up daily deployments instead of end-of-sprint
>
> Result: Delivered 9 features (1 moved to next sprint), zero production bugs, test coverage increased to 84%. Speed came from automation, not from lowering standards.'
>
> **Philosophy**: Technical debt from rushing creates more slowness later. The fastest way to go fast is to maintain quality. DevOps done right accelerates delivery AND improves quality."

**Why It's Strong**: Reframes the question (not a trade-off), provides concrete strategies, includes metrics, gives real example with outcomes.

## Category 6: Salesforce-Specific DevOps

### Q26: How do you handle Salesforce metadata dependencies in deployments?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Deploy dependencies first."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Salesforce metadata dependencies are the #1 cause of deployment failures. You need both tooling and process to handle them.
>
> **Understanding dependency types**:
>
> **1. Explicit dependencies** (Salesforce enforces):
> - Custom field referenced in page layout
> - Validation rule using a field
> - Class referenced in trigger
> - Flow referencing a class
>
> **2. Implicit dependencies** (not enforced but break functionality):
> - Permission set grants access to field
> - Record type available in page layout
> - Profile has access to tab
>
> **Handling in deployments**:
>
> **3. Dependency analysis tools**:
> ```bash
> # Salesforce Dependency API
> sf project generate manifest --from-org DevOrg
>
> # Or use VS Code Org Browser to visualize dependencies
> ```
>
> **4. Deployment order strategy**:
> ```
> Phase 1: Schema
>   - Objects
>   - Fields
>   - Record types
>
> Phase 2: Business logic
>   - Apex classes
>   - Triggers
>   - Validation rules
>   - Workflows
>
> Phase 3: UI
>   - Page layouts
>   - Lightning pages
>   - Visualforce pages
>
> Phase 4: Security
>   - Permission sets
>   - Profiles
> ```
>
> **5. Manifest file organization**:
> ```xml
> <!-- base-package.xml: Required first -->
> <types>
>   <name>CustomObject</name>
>   <members>*</members>
> </types>
> <types>
>   <name>CustomField</name>
>   <members>*</members>
> </types>
>
> <!-- app-package.xml: Deployed second -->
> <types>
>   <name>ApexClass</name>
>   <members>*</members>
> </types>
> <types>
>   <name>ApexTrigger</name>
>   <members>*</members>
> </types>
> ```
>
> **6. Pipeline implementation**:
> ```yaml
> deploy_phase1:
>   script:
>     - sf project deploy start --manifest base-package.xml
>
> deploy_phase2:
>   script:
>     - sf project deploy start --manifest app-package.xml
>   depends_on:
>     - deploy_phase1
> ```
>
> **Handling circular dependencies**:
>
> **7. Custom object with lookup to itself**:
> ```
> Step 1: Deploy object without lookup field
> Step 2: Deploy lookup field in separate deployment
> ```
>
> **8. Two objects with lookups to each other**:
> ```
> Step 1: Deploy both objects without lookup fields
> Step 2: Deploy both lookup fields
> ```
>
> **9. Use package.xml wildcards carefully**:
> ```xml
> <!-- Bad: Might fail on dependencies -->
> <members>*</members>
>
> <!-- Better: Explicit order -->
> <members>Account</members>
> <members>Contact</members>
> <members>Opportunity</members>
> ```
>
> **Prevention**:
>
> **10. Source format helps**:
> - Individual files for each component
> - Easier to deploy subset
> - Clear dependency visibility
>
> **11. Scratch orgs for testing**:
> - Start from empty org
> - Deploy in order
> - Catches dependency issues early
>
> **Example failure and fix**:
> 'Deployment failed: "Error: In field: Account.Custom_Field__c - no CustomField named Account.Custom_Field__c found."
>
> The page layout referenced the field, but field wasn't in the deployment package. Fixed by:
> 1. Adding field to manifest
> 2. Creating dependency checker script that parses layout XML for field references
> 3. Integrated into CI/CD to catch this automatically
>
> Now before every deployment, script validates all references exist in package or target org.'"

**Why It's Strong**: Shows deep understanding of Salesforce metadata, provides multiple strategies, includes automation and prevention.

### Q27: Explain how you'd implement org-to-org deployment vs source-driven development

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Source-driven is better."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Both models have use cases. The choice depends on team maturity, existing processes, and organizational constraints.
>
> **Org-to-Org Deployment** (traditional):
>
> **How it works**:
> - Develop in source sandbox
> - Create change set with components
> - Upload to target sandbox
> - Validate and deploy
> - Manual tracking in spreadsheets
>
> **Pros**:
> - Familiar to Salesforce admins
> - No Git knowledge required
> - Works with declarative development (clicks)
> - Easy to see what's in each change set
>
> **Cons**:
> - No version control
> - Can't see history of changes
> - Hard to collaborate (merge conflicts)
> - Manual process prone to errors
> - Can't automate easily
>
> **Source-Driven Development** (modern):
>
> **How it works**:
> - Pull metadata to local repository
> - Track changes in Git
> - Commit changes to branch
> - Automated deployment via CI/CD
> - Metadata stored in source format
>
> **Pros**:
> - Full version history
> - Collaboration through Git
> - Automated testing and deployment
> - Rollback capability
> - Works with modern DevOps tools
>
> **Cons**:
> - Learning curve (Git, SFDX CLI)
> - Requires pipeline setup
> - More complex for non-developers
>
> **Migration strategy** (org-to-org → source-driven):
>
> **Phase 1: Hybrid** (3 months)
> - Continue change sets for production
> - Start using Git for development
> - Developers pull metadata, commit to Git
> - Still deploy via change sets
> - Goal: Build Git muscle memory
>
> **Phase 2: Parallel** (3 months)
> - Set up CI/CD pipeline
> - Some deployments via pipeline (Dev, Integration)
> - Production still via change sets
> - Goal: Validate pipeline reliability
>
> **Phase 3: Source-driven** (ongoing)
> - All deployments via pipeline
> - Change sets deprecated
> - Git is source of truth
>
> **Which to recommend?**
>
> **Use org-to-org when**:
> - Small team (< 5 people)
> - Infrequent deployments (monthly)
> - Mostly admins (not developers)
> - Simple org (no complex integrations)
>
> **Use source-driven when**:
> - Multiple teams
> - Frequent deployments (weekly or more)
> - Developer-heavy team
> - Complex org with integrations
> - Compliance requirements
>
> **Australia Post recommendation**:
> With 50+ developers, 5 teams, monthly releases, and compliance requirements, source-driven is the only scalable approach. I'd implement a 6-month migration:
> - Month 1-2: Git training for all developers
> - Month 3-4: Set up CI/CD pipeline, test with Dev/Int environments
> - Month 5: First automated UAT deployment
> - Month 6: First automated Production deployment
> - Ongoing: Iterate and optimize
>
> But I'd keep a change set process as emergency backup for the first year until everyone's confident with the new workflow."

**Why It's Strong**: Compares both objectively, provides migration path, context-specific recommendation, acknowledges transition challenges.

### Q28: How do you manage environment-specific configuration (dev vs prod)?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Use custom settings."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Environment-specific configuration is critical—you don't want test API keys in production or production URLs in dev. Here's a layered approach:
>
> **Layer 1: Custom Metadata Types** (preferred for most config)
>
> **Why**:
> - Deployable via metadata API
> - Version controlled in Git
> - Type-safe (define fields)
> - Cacheable (fast at runtime)
>
> **Structure**:
> ```
> Custom Metadata Type: Integration_Config__mdt
>
> Fields:
> - API_Endpoint__c (URL)
> - API_Key__c (Encrypted Text)
> - Timeout__c (Number)
> - Enable_Debug__c (Checkbox)
>
> Records:
> - Dev_Config
> - UAT_Config
> - Prod_Config
> ```
>
> **Usage**:
> ```apex
> Integration_Config__mdt config = Integration_Config__mdt.getInstance('Dev_Config');
> String endpoint = config.API_Endpoint__c;
> ```
>
> **Deployment**:
> ```bash
> # Deploy different values to each environment
> sf project deploy start --metadata CustomMetadata:Integration_Config__mdt.Dev_Config --target-org DevOrg
> sf project deploy start --metadata CustomMetadata:Integration_Config__mdt.Prod_Config --target-org ProdOrg
> ```
>
> **Layer 2: Named Credentials** (for external integrations)
>
> **Why**:
> - Secure storage of credentials
> - OAuth token management
> - Per-user or per-org
> - Encrypted at rest
>
> **Setup**:
> ```
> Named Credential: ExternalAPI_Dev
> - URL: https://api-dev.external.com
> - Identity Type: Named Principal
> - Authentication: Password
>
> Named Credential: ExternalAPI_Prod
> - URL: https://api.external.com
> - Identity Type: Named Principal
> - Authentication: OAuth
> ```
>
> **Usage**:
> ```apex
> HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
> req.setEndpoint('callout:ExternalAPI_Dev/users');
> // Salesforce handles authentication automatically
> ```
>
> **Layer 3: Custom Settings** (for user-specific config)
>
> **When to use**:
> - Configuration varies by user
> - Frequently changed values
> - User preferences
>
> **Example**:
> ```
> Custom Setting: User_Preferences__c (Hierarchy)
>
> Fields:
> - Dashboard_Refresh_Rate__c
> - Email_Notifications__c
> ```
>
> **Layer 4: Environment Detection in Code**
>
> **Dynamic environment detection**:
> ```apex
> public class EnvironmentUtil {
>     public static String getEnvironment() {
>         String orgId = UserInfo.getOrganizationId();
>         String domain = URL.getOrgDomainUrl().toExternalForm();
>
>         if (domain.contains('--dev')) return 'DEV';
>         if (domain.contains('--uat')) return 'UAT';
>         if (domain.contains('sandbox')) return 'SANDBOX';
>         return 'PRODUCTION';
>     }
>
>     public static Boolean isProduction() {
>         return getEnvironment() == 'PRODUCTION';
>     }
> }
>
> // Usage
> if (EnvironmentUtil.isProduction()) {
>     // Production-specific logic
>     sendRealEmail();
> } else {
>     // Test environment logic
>     sendTestEmail();
> }
> ```
>
> **Layer 5: Deployment-time substitution** (CI/CD)
>
> **Pipeline variables**:
> ```yaml
> deploy_to_dev:
>   variables:
>     SALESFORCE_ENDPOINT: $DEV_ENDPOINT
>     API_KEY: $DEV_API_KEY
>   script:
>     - deploy.sh
>
> deploy_to_prod:
>   variables:
>     SALESFORCE_ENDPOINT: $PROD_ENDPOINT
>     API_KEY: $PROD_API_KEY
>   script:
>     - deploy.sh
> ```
>
> **Complete pattern**:
>
> ```apex
> public class IntegrationService {
>     private static final String CONFIG_NAME = EnvironmentUtil.isProduction()
>         ? 'Prod_Config'
>         : 'Dev_Config';
>
>     public static void callExternalAPI() {
>         Integration_Config__mdt config = Integration_Config__mdt.getInstance(CONFIG_NAME);
>
>         HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
>         req.setEndpoint(config.API_Endpoint__c);
>         req.setHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + config.API_Key__c);
>         req.setTimeout(config.Timeout__c.intValue());
>
>         if (config.Enable_Debug__c) {
>             System.debug('Request: ' + req);
>         }
>
>         Http http = new Http();
>         HttpResponse res = http.send(req);
>
>         return res;
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> **Best practices**:
> 1. Never hardcode environment-specific values
> 2. Never commit credentials to Git
> 3. Use Named Credentials for external APIs
> 4. Use Custom Metadata for configuration
> 5. Deploy different config values to each org
> 6. Document what config exists where
> 7. Test config retrieval in unit tests
>
> **Example scenario**:
> 'We integrate with DocuSign. Dev environment uses DocuSign sandbox, Production uses DocuSign live. Created Custom Metadata Type: DocuSign_Config__mdt with two records: Dev_DocuSign (sandbox URL) and Prod_DocuSign (live URL). Code detects environment and loads appropriate config. Same code deployed everywhere, different behavior based on metadata. No code changes needed when switching environments.'"

### Q29: How do you handle data migration as part of deployments?

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Use Data Loader."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Data migration is often more complex than metadata deployment because it involves state, relationships, and can't be easily rolled back. Here's a structured approach:
>
> **Types of data migrations**:
>
> **1. Reference data** (picklist values, products, price books)
> - Small volume
> - Changes infrequently
> - Should be versioned and automated
>
> **2. Configuration data** (record types, custom settings, org-wide defaults)
> - Part of environment setup
> - Should be in Git
> - Deployed with metadata
>
> **3. Historical data** (migrating from legacy system)
> - Large volume
> - One-time migration
> - Requires ETL tools
>
> **4. Structural changes** (adding field, splitting one object into two)
> - Affects existing data
> - Requires transformation
> - High risk
>
> **Approach for each type**:
>
> **Reference data automation**:
>
> ```bash
> # Export reference data
> sf data export tree --query "SELECT Name, Code__c, Active__c FROM Product2" --output-dir data/
>
> # Creates: data/Product2s.json and data/Product2-plan.json
>
> # Commit to Git
> git add data/
> git commit -m "Add product reference data"
>
> # Import in CI/CD pipeline
> sf data import tree --plan data/Product2-plan.json --target-org UAT
> ```
>
> **Configuration data with Custom Metadata**:
>
> ```xml
> <!-- Deployed as metadata, not data -->
> <CustomMetadata xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
>     <label>Default Settings</label>
>     <protected>false</protected>
>     <values>
>         <field>Opportunity_Threshold__c</field>
>         <value>50000</value>
>     </values>
> </CustomMetadata>
> ```
>
> **Structural data migration pattern**:
>
> **Example: Adding Status__c field, need to populate based on existing Stage__c**
>
> **Phase 1: Add field (zero downtime)**
> ```bash
> # Deploy new field (initially blank)
> sf project deploy start --metadata CustomField:Opportunity.Status__c
> ```
>
> **Phase 2: Backfill data**
> ```apex
> // Batch Apex to populate new field
> global class MigrateOpportunityStatus implements Database.Batchable<SObject> {
>     global Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
>         return Database.getQueryLocator(
>             'SELECT Id, StageName, Status__c FROM Opportunity WHERE Status__c = null'
>         );
>     }
>
>     global void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc, List<Opportunity> opps) {
>         for (Opportunity opp : opps) {
>             if (opp.StageName == 'Closed Won') {
>                 opp.Status__c = 'Complete';
>             } else if (opp.StageName == 'Closed Lost') {
>                 opp.Status__c = 'Cancelled';
>             } else {
>                 opp.Status__c = 'In Progress';
>             }
>         }
>         update opps;
>     }
>
>     global void finish(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
>         System.debug('Migration complete');
>     }
> }
>
> // Execute in production
> Database.executeBatch(new MigrateOpportunityStatus(), 200);
> ```
>
> **Phase 3: Validate**
> ```sql
> -- Check how many records still need migration
> SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity WHERE Status__c = null
>
> -- Should be 0
> ```
>
> **Phase 4: Deploy dependent logic**
> ```bash
> # Now safe to deploy code that depends on Status__c
> sf project deploy start --metadata ApexClass:OpportunityStatusHandler
> ```
>
> **Large data migration strategy**:
>
> **Tools by volume**:
> - < 50,000 records: Data Loader
> - 50K - 1M records: Bulk API
> - > 1M records: ETL tool (Informatica, MuleSoft, Talend)
>
> **Migration checklist**:
> ```markdown
> ## Data Migration Plan: Opportunity Status Field
>
> ### Pre-migration
> - [ ] Backup production data (full export)
> - [ ] Test migration script in sandbox with production data
> - [ ] Verify migration logic with business users
> - [ ] Plan rollback procedure
> - [ ] Set up monitoring for migration errors
>
> ### Migration
> - [ ] Deploy Status__c field
> - [ ] Execute batch job to backfill data
> - [ ] Monitor batch job completion
> - [ ] Verify data accuracy (sample 100 records)
>
> ### Post-migration
> - [ ] Deploy dependent functionality
> - [ ] Validate end-to-end user workflows
> - [ ] Remove old fields (if planned)
> - [ ] Document migration completion
> ```
>
> **CI/CD integration**:
>
> ```yaml
> deploy_migration:
>   script:
>     # Deploy field
>     - sf project deploy start --metadata CustomField:Opportunity.Status__c
>
>     # Execute migration
>     - sf apex run --file scripts/execute-migration.apex
>
>     # Wait for batch to complete
>     - ./wait-for-batch-completion.sh
>
>     # Validate
>     - sf data query --query "SELECT COUNT() FROM Opportunity WHERE Status__c = null" --use-tooling-api false
>
>     # Deploy dependent code
>     - sf project deploy start --metadata ApexClass:OpportunityStatusHandler
>   only:
>     - main
>   when: manual  # Requires approval
> ```
>
> **Rollback plan**:
> ```bash
> # If migration fails:
> # 1. Restore from backup
> sf data import tree --plan backups/opportunities-backup.json
>
> # 2. Or clear bad data
> DELETE FROM Opportunity WHERE Status__c = 'ERROR'
>
> # 3. Re-run migration with fixed logic
> ```
>
> **Key principles**:
> 1. Never modify data without backup
> 2. Test migration with production-like data volume
> 3. Use batch processing for large volumes
> 4. Validate data after migration
> 5. Keep migration scripts in Git for documentation
> 6. Separate metadata deployment from data migration
> 7. Make data migrations idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
>
> This approach has handled migrations of 50M+ records with zero downtime."

### Q30: Explain your approach to handling Salesforce governor limits in a DevOps context

**Weak Answer** ❌:
> "Write bulkified code."

**Strong Answer** ✅:
> "Governor limits are Salesforce's resource constraints, and they affect both development practices and deployment strategy. I handle them at multiple levels:
>
> **Prevention (Design Time)**:
>
> **1. Coding standards**:
> ```apex
> // Enforce patterns that avoid limits
>
> // ❌ SOQL in loop
> for (Account acc : accounts) {
>     Contact c = [SELECT Name FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = :acc.Id];
> }
>
> // ✅ Bulkified
> Map<Id, List<Contact>> contactsByAccount = new Map<Id, List<Contact>>();
> for (Contact c : [SELECT AccountId, Name FROM Contact WHERE AccountId IN :accountIds]) {
>     if (!contactsByAccount.containsKey(c.AccountId)) {
>         contactsByAccount.put(c.AccountId, new List<Contact>());
>     }
>     contactsByAccount.get(c.AccountId).add(c);
> }
> ```
>
> **2. Code review checklist**:
> - No SOQL in loops
> - No DML in loops
> - Trigger is handler pattern (single point of entry)
> - Collections over individual records
> - Selective SOQL (use WHERE clauses)
>
> **Detection (CI/CD)**:
>
> **3. Static code analysis**:
> ```yaml
> code_scan:
>   script:
>     - pmd-scan --rulesets apex-ruleset.xml
>     # Flags: SOQL in loop, DML in loop, cyclomatic complexity
>   allow_failure: false
> ```
>
> **4. Required test patterns**:
> ```apex
> // Every trigger test must include bulk test
> @isTest
> static void testBulkOperation() {
>     List<Account> accounts = new List<Account>();
>     for (Integer i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
>         accounts.add(new Account(Name = 'Test ' + i));
>     }
>
>     Test.startTest();
>     insert accounts;  // If not bulkified, this fails
>     Test.stopTest();
>
>     // Verify all 200 processed successfully
>     System.assertEquals(200, [SELECT COUNT() FROM Account]);
> }
> ```
>
> **5. CI/CD enforcement**:
> ```yaml
> test_with_bulk:
>   script:
>     - sf apex run test --test-level RunLocalTests
>     - check_for_limit_usage.sh  # Custom script
>   rules:
>     - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
>       allow_failure: false
> ```
>
> **Monitoring (Production)**:
>
> **6. Limit usage tracking**:
> ```apex
> public class LimitsMonitor {
>     public static void checkLimits() {
>         Integer queriesUsed = Limits.getQueries();
>         Integer queriesLimit = Limits.getLimitQueries();
>
>         if (queriesUsed > (queriesLimit * 0.8)) {
>             // Using > 80% of limit
>             logWarning('High SOQL usage: ' + queriesUsed + '/' + queriesLimit);
>         }
>     }
> }
>
> // Call at strategic points
> AccountTriggerHandler.handle();
> LimitsMonitor.checkLimits();
> ```
>
> **7. Event Monitoring**:
> - Track limit exceptions in production
> - Alert when limit exceptions > threshold
> - Dashboard showing limit usage trends
>
> **Handling specific limits**:
>
> **8. SOQL queries (101 limit)**:
> ```apex
> // Collect all IDs first
> Set<Id> accountIds = new Set<Id>();
> for (Opportunity opp : opportunities) {
>     accountIds.add(opp.AccountId);
> }
>
> // Single query for all
> Map<Id, Account> accountMap = new Map<Id, Account>(
>     [SELECT Id, Name, Industry FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds]
> );
>
> // Use map in loop
> for (Opportunity opp : opportunities) {
>     Account acc = accountMap.get(opp.AccountId);
> }
> ```
>
> **9. DML statements (150 limit)**:
> ```apex
> // Batch DML operations
> List<Account> accountsToUpdate = new List<Account>();
>
> for (Account acc : accounts) {
>     acc.Rating = 'Hot';
>     accountsToUpdate.add(acc);
> }
>
> // Single DML for all
> update accountsToUpdate;
> ```
>
> **10. CPU time (10 seconds)**:
> ```apex
> // Move heavy processing to @future or Queueable
> @future
> public static void heavyProcessing(Set<Id> recordIds) {
>     // Complex calculations here
>     // Gets separate limits
> }
>
> // Or use Platform Events for async
> EventBus.publish(new Heavy_Processing__e(Record_Id__c = acc.Id));
> ```
>
> **11. Heap size (6MB synchronous)**:
> ```apex
> // Don't load everything into memory
> // ❌ Bad
> List<Account> allAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name, (SELECT Name FROM Contacts) FROM Account];
>
> // ✅ Good - Process in batches
> Database.executeBatch(new ProcessAccountsBatch(), 200);
> ```
>
> **Scaling beyond limits**:
>
> **12. Batch Apex** (for large data volumes):
> ```apex
> global class ProcessLargeDataset implements Database.Batchable<SObject> {
>     global Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
>         return Database.getQueryLocator('SELECT Id FROM Account');
>     }
>
>     global void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc, List<Account> scope) {
>         // Process 200 records at a time
>         // Each batch gets fresh limits
>     }
>
>     global void finish(Database.BatchableContext bc) {
>         // Cleanup
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> **13. Platform Events** (for decoupling):
> ```apex
> // Instead of synchronous trigger doing everything
> trigger AccountTrigger on Account (after update) {
>     List<Account_Updated__e> events = new List<Account_Updated__e>();
>     for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
>         events.add(new Account_Updated__e(Account_Id__c = acc.Id));
>     }
>     EventBus.publish(events);
>     // Trigger completes quickly, processing happens async
> }
> ```
>
> **Deployment considerations**:
>
> **14. Test execution limits**:
> - Synchronous tests: 10 minutes total
> - Individual test: 60 seconds
> - Strategy: Split test classes to parallelize
>
> **15. Deployment API limits**:
> - Metadata API calls: 15,000 per 24 hours
> - Strategy: Deploy once per environment per day max
>
> **Real example**:
> 'Production was hitting CPU time limits on OpportunityTrigger during bulk updates from data loader. 5,000 opportunities timing out.
>
> Investigation: Trigger was doing complex ROI calculations synchronously.
>
> Fix:
> 1. Immediate: Added flag to skip calculation for bulk loads
> 2. Week 1: Refactored calculation to Queueable Apex
> 3. Week 2: Split into Platform Event: Trigger publishes event, subscriber does calculation async
> 4. Testing: Added test with 200 records, verified CPU time < 5 seconds
> 5. Monitoring: Added CPU time tracking, alert if > 7 seconds
>
> Result: Bulk loads complete in 2 minutes (was timing out), no limits hit, can scale to 10K records.'"
