### The 5 Things That Will Get You Hired

3. **Problem-Solving Approach** - Think aloud, ask questions, consider trade-offs
4. **Relevant Experience** - Connect your past work to their needs
5. **Genuine Enthusiasm** - Show real interest in company and role

### The 5 Things That Will Get You Rejected

3. **Too Vague** - "I worked on a project" without specifics
4. **Not Prepared** - Don't know basic Git commands or Salesforce concepts

## 💪 Final Words of Encouragement

**Remember**:
- You don't need to know everything

**You've Got This** ✨

You've done the work. You've built the projects. You've practiced the questions. Now trust your preparation and let your authentic self shine through.

**The interview is a conversation, not an interrogation.** Be yourself, show your work, and explain your thinking. That's all they're asking for.

Good luck! 🚀
