# What is Salesforce DevOps (and why should you care?)

**Learning Objective**: Understand what DevOps means in Salesforce context and why it matters for your career.

## The Monday Morning Disaster

Picture this: It's Monday morning. Your sales team just discovered that the opportunity page is broken. Marketing's new email automation is sending blank emails. And customer service can't access the cases they need.

All because three different teams deployed changes to Salesforce on Friday afternoon. Nobody knew what anyone else was doing.

Sound familiar?

You spend the next 4 hours in emergency meetings. Someone mentions "maybe we should revert?" But nobody knows how. The changes are already in production. Users are getting frustrated. Your boss asks "how did this happen?"

You don't have a good answer.

This is what happens without DevOps.

## So What Actually IS Salesforce DevOps?

Let's skip the corporate buzzwords. Here's what DevOps actually means:

**DevOps is treating your Salesforce changes like professional software development.**

That means:
- Every change goes through version control (Git)
- Changes are tested automatically before reaching production
- Deployments happen through repeatable, automated pipelines
- Everyone knows what's being deployed, when, and by whom
- If something breaks, you can roll back in minutes

Think of it like this: right now, you're probably making changes directly in Salesforce. It's like writing code directly on a live website. One typo and everything breaks.

DevOps says: "Let's build changes in a safe environment, test them thoroughly, and then deploy them with confidence."

## Why Salesforce DevOps Is Different From Regular DevOps

You might be thinking: "I've heard of DevOps for websites and apps. How is Salesforce different?"

Great question. Salesforce DevOps has unique challenges:

### It's Metadata, Not Just Code

When you create a custom field in Salesforce, you're not writing code. You're clicking buttons in Setup. Behind the scenes, Salesforce generates XML files called "metadata."

Your validation rule? XML. Your page layout? XML. Your Apex class? That's code, but it's wrapped in... you guessed it, XML.

DevOps for Salesforce means managing these metadata files in Git and deploying them through pipelines.

### Everything Lives in One Shared Org

With traditional software, each developer gets their own isolated environment. With Salesforce, you often have 5 developers sharing one sandbox org.

Someone changes a field. You pull those changes. Now your code references a field that might change again tomorrow.

This is why coordination matters even more in Salesforce DevOps.

### Clicks AND Code

Your team has both:
- Admins who configure through clicks in Setup
- Developers who write Apex and Lightning components

Both are making changes. Both need to follow the same DevOps process. That's unusual. Most DevOps is just for developers.

### Hidden Dependencies Everywhere

In Salesforce, everything connects to everything else:
- Your Apex trigger depends on a custom field
- Which is used in a validation rule
- Which is displayed on a page layout
- Which is assigned to a profile
- Which is used by Process Builder
- Which updates another field...

Deploy things in the wrong order? Everything breaks. DevOps helps you manage these dependencies.

## The Pain Points Salesforce DevOps Solves

Let's be honest about what's broken right now (if you don't have DevOps):

### Problem 1: Conflicting Changes
Two teams modify the same Apex class in different sandboxes. Both try to deploy. The second deployment overwrites the first. Code is lost. Features break.

**DevOps solution**: Git merge conflicts catch this before deployment. You resolve conflicts once, in code, not in production.

### Problem 2: "Who Changed What?" Mysteries
Something broke in production. You have no idea who changed it, when, or why. You check the setup audit trail but it only shows "System Administrator" did something 3 weeks ago.

**DevOps solution**: Every change is a Git commit with author, timestamp, and description. Full audit trail forever.

### Problem 3: Untested Changes Breaking Production
A developer makes a "quick fix" directly in production. Doesn't test it. Breaks the entire checkout flow for 10,000 customers.

**DevOps solution**: All changes go through a pipeline that runs tests. If tests fail, deployment is blocked. Automatically.

### Problem 4: No Rollback Plan
Your Friday afternoon deployment goes wrong. Really wrong. You need to undo it. But how? Manually recreate the old configuration? That'll take hours. Users are affected right now.

**DevOps solution**: Git knows exactly what changed. You revert the commit, redeploy the previous version. 10 minutes, not 4 hours.

### Problem 5: Manual Deployments Take Forever
You spend 3 hours copying metadata from sandbox to production using change sets. You miss a dependency. Deployment fails. Start over.

**DevOps solution**: Automated pipeline deploys everything in the right order. Every time. Takes 15 minutes. You don't have to think about it.

## A Day in the Life: DevOps Lead at Australia Post

Let's make this concrete. Imagine you're a DevOps Lead at Australia Post, managing Salesforce across their enterprise.

**Your Monday morning looks like this:**

- **9:00 AM**: Three teams want to deploy this week - Sales Cloud enhancements, Service Cloud case management updates, and Community Cloud customer portal changes.

- **9:15 AM**: You review the GitLab pipeline status. All three feature branches have passed automated tests. No conflicts detected.

- **9:30 AM**: Team A's pull request is ready. You review the changes in Git, see exactly what metadata will deploy. Approve the merge.

- **9:45 AM**: Pipeline automatically validates the changes against UAT environment. Tests pass. Deployment to UAT completes successfully.

- **10:00 AM**: Stakeholders test in UAT throughout the day. No issues found.

- **4:00 PM**: You schedule the production deployment for Sunday 11 PM (low-traffic window). The pipeline will handle it automatically.

- **Sunday 11:05 PM**: You get a Slack notification: "Production deployment successful. All tests passed." You don't even have to be at your computer.

This is what good DevOps looks like. Everything is:
- **Coordinated** (you know what all three teams are doing)
- **Tested** (automatically, before production)
- **Traceable** (full history in Git)
- **Automated** (pipeline does the work)
- **Reversible** (if something breaks, rollback in minutes)

Without DevOps? You'd be manually coordinating change sets, discovering conflicts in production, and spending your Sunday night firefighting.

## The Transformation: Before vs. After

Let me show you what changes when you implement DevOps:

### Before DevOps

**Deployments:**
- Manual change sets created by hand
- Takes 3-4 hours per deployment
- "Did we include everything?" anxiety
- Fails 30% of the time due to missing dependencies

**Testing:**
- "We tested it in sandbox, should be fine"
- No automated tests run before deployment
- Find bugs in production

**Coordination:**
- "Let me know when you're deploying so I don't deploy at the same time"
- Tribal knowledge about what's in flight
- Surprise conflicts in production

**When things break:**
- Panic
- 4-hour emergency fix sessions
- "Let's just fix it forward"
- No clear way to revert

**Team morale:**
- Developers afraid to deploy
- Friday afternoon deployments = weekend on-call
- "It worked in my sandbox!"

### After DevOps

**Deployments:**
- Automated pipeline does the work
- Takes 15-20 minutes
- Includes all dependencies automatically
- 95% success rate

**Testing:**
- Automated tests run on every commit
- Code coverage requirements enforced
- Issues caught before they reach production

**Coordination:**
- All changes visible in GitLab
- Branch strategy prevents conflicts
- Clear view of what's being worked on

**When things break:**
- Rollback procedure is documented and tested
- Revert the Git commit, redeploy
- Back to working state in 10 minutes

**Team morale:**
- Confidence in deployments
- Deploy any time, any day
- Focus on features, not deployment logistics

## Why This Matters for Your Career

Here's the reality: companies with mature Salesforce implementations need DevOps. It's not optional anymore.

Australia Post isn't hiring a DevOps Lead because it sounds cool. They're hiring because manual deployments don't scale. When you have 50+ developers, multiple clouds, and business-critical processes, you need professional DevOps.

Learning Salesforce DevOps makes you:
- **More valuable**: DevOps skills are in high demand and short supply
- **More confident**: You understand how enterprise Salesforce actually works
- **More employable**: DevOps Lead roles pay 20-30% more than standard Salesforce roles
- **More effective**: You ship features faster with fewer incidents

This isn't just about tools. It's about thinking like an engineer: make changes safe, repeatable, and reversible.

## Up Next: Understanding Salesforce Environments

Now that you understand WHY DevOps matters, let's talk about WHERE these changes happen.

You need to understand Salesforce environments before we can build anything. What's the difference between a Developer sandbox and a Full sandbox? When should you use a scratch org? How do changes flow from development to production?

That's what we'll cover next: **[Understanding Salesforce Environments →](/docs/foundations/understanding-environments)**

You're building the mental models you need. Every concept builds on the previous one. Trust the process.
